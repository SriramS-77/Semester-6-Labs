            <div style="text-align: center;">
                Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, <br>

                And sorry I could not travel both <br>

                And be one traveler, long I stood <br>

                And looked down one as far as I could <br><br>

                To where it bent in the undergrowth; <br>

                Then took the other, as just as fair, <br>

                And having perhaps the better claim, <br>

                Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br><br>

                Though as for that the passing there <br>

                Had worn them really about the same, <br>

                And both that morning equally lay <br>

                In leaves no step had trodden black. <br><br>

                Oh, I kept the first for another day! <br>

                Yet knowing how way leads on to way, <br>

                I doubted if I should ever come back. <br>

                I shall be telling this with a sigh <br><br>

                Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br>

                Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” <br>

                I took the one less traveled by, <br>

                And that has made all the difference. <br><br>
